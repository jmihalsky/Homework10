Homework 10 - liribot node.js

The liribot was design to handle both command based options or menu selection options.

The command based works based off of predefined command arguments and arguments of what will perform a search.
The command line works with the search item either encapsulated in quotes or anything after the search command.

Options:
1. concert-this: searches bands in town.
